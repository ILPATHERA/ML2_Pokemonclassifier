# ML2_Image Classifier for Pokemon

This project is an image classifier specifically designed to identify different Pokemon species. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and classify images of Pokemon based on their visual features.

## Installation

- Download the jupyter notebook and upload it on google colab. Every dependency should be installed if not there is the code in the jupyter notebook.

- Download the kaggle.json file from the GitHub repository and upload it to the Jupyter Notebook or your local environment. This file is required to access the dataset from Kaggle.

- Download the openai_key.txt for OpenAI from the provided text file and upload it to the appropriate location in the project. This key is necessary to utilize the OpenAI API for text generation.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook and click threw code.

The project relies on a collection of Pokemon images for training and testing the image classifier.

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the model, test its performance, and classify new images of Pokemon.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of images of various Pokemon species. The images are labeled with the corresponding Pokemon names. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and should be accessed using the provided kaggle.json file.

## Testdata 

The images used for testing need a specific format so i uploaded the testfiles on github, so you can use them for testing the model.

## Model Training

The image classifier is trained using a machine learning algorithm, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model architecture, hyperparameters, and training techniques are implemented within the project.

## Results
The project evaluates the performance of the image classifier using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Improvements

There are several areas for potential improvement in this project, including:

Enhancing the model architecture to achieve higher accuracy
Expanding the dataset with more diverse Pokemon images
Implementing data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization
Exploring advanced machine learning algorithms for better performance
Contributions to these areas or any other improvements are welcomed.
